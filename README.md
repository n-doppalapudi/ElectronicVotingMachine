# ElectronicVotingMachine
CPT_S 583 Project 

Project Description:
	The Electronic Voting System is a web based interface that will enable users to cast their votes privately from remote 
  locations. The voting system will include the voter information, candidate profile, deadlines for voting, and analysis 
  of results. This system is based on the concept of democratic voting that is one person one vote system. The voter would 
  be authenticated before he/she casts their vote in order to ensure security is achieved. The authenticated voter is then 
  prompted to vote on the web application. After he/she votes she is given the choice of locking her vote or changing it. 
  Once the voting time is completed the system then evaluates and generates the result. The results would be declared on the web portal.
